I wrote this java code CalculateFinalPrice.java to demonstrate the use of Apache POI library to read data from a MS excel file (used as automative inventory). Then it will also do some tax calculation based on user input, then show the output (final price for the selected automatives) depending on the selection.

The input excel file is also attached. The code can be compiled and run by simply updating the input excel file location depending on where you keep the excel file on your local repository.
